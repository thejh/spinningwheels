      You have a bunch of people and want to know how they can work in groups a few times so that everyone has seen everyone else?
      Without people seeing each other countless times? Well, this is the solution. Just enter a number of people and get a result
      in the format <code>person: group1 group2 group3...</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number of people:
      <input type="text" id="peopleCount">
      <button id="button">
        OK
      </button>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code id="output">
      </code>
